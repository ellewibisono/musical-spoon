probable pancakes team

Let's use this space to determine what variables we want to compare/ look 
at!! 
Welcome to Team Pancakes! 

Maggie: Should I look at does GDP predict life-expectancy? These are the instructions from Sakai. 
What we need:
 1. Load the data
 2. Contain plots that illustrate relationships between variables and cases where relationships do not exist
 3. Contain plots with data divided by category as needed
 4. Include captions and descriptions of plots
 5. Show only informative output (not code or raw results)
 6. Include R-squared and p-values as necessary to support relationships. These should be written in text not output as raw results.
 7. Format text and results appropriately including headers and inline code.
